# Steven Liu . Jarvis Consulting

Problem solver, culture explorer, lifelong learner. Before joining Jarvis, I graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with an Honors B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Statistics. The blend of academic training has given me both solid coding and analytical skills. I found my interest in data engineering in my final year of university, which is a discipline that includes all the exciting things I am passionate about. I look forward to opportunities to utilize and develop my skills from Jarvis' clients in Toronto.

## Skills

**Proficient:** Java (Spring, JPA/Hibernate), C++, R, Bash, SQL, Agile/Scrum, Statistics

**Competent:** Python, Node.js, Docker, Cloud Computing, Machine learning (Scikit-learn, Keras) 

**Familiar:** Angular, Kubernetes, Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Haskell, DevOps (Jenkins, Travis CI) 

## Development Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_steve](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_steve)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: Followed the software development practices including Agile and Gitflow, I developed an internal tool for cluster administration team to automate database server provision and server usage monitoring. I also wrote clear documentation on architecture design and scripts usage.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**: Developed three Java applications: Grep App, JDBC Demo, and Twitter CLI App. Maven is used as the project configuration & building tool and JUnit4 and Mockito for unit & integration testing. I got familiar with many key concepts in web development such as HTTP, JSON, MVC, and Spring framework in this project.
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**:  Developed an online stock trading simulation platform. The system is designed with microservice architecture, implemented with Java 8 and SpringBoot. PostgreSQL database and JPA/Hibernate are utilized to persist market/user/transaction data. Users will be able to play trading games via REST API or Swagger UI.
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: **In-progress**
- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: **In-progress**
- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  Not started

## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer Associate, Jarvis, Toronto (2020-Present):** I'm working on projects using core big data technologies including Cloud, DevOps, Java, Hadoop and Spark. As a team member, I'm responsible for performing the duties of Scrum master in Agile-based team projects to clear obstacles, ensure team cohesion, address collaborative dynamics, and facilitate goal management.

**Software Developer, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon (2019-2020):** Developed R package [HTLR](https://github.com/longhaiSK/HTLR) for high-dimensional data analysis. In particular, I refactored the legacy C modules with C++ and OOP design. The core Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm has been optimized to get improved by 30% in speed. I also wrote the package documentation and the user manual.

**Data Scientist, Social Sciences Research Laboratories (SSRL), Saskatoon (2018-2019):** Collected data from Twitter REST API and performed data cleaning transformation; Performed data mining tasks including bot detection, sentiment analysis, emotion extraction, topic modelling, and social network analysis on 100,000+ tweets and 50,000 users; Produced analysis summary ([work samples](https://rpubs.com/xil865/)), reported to the project director.

## Education & Academic Projects

**University of Saskatchewan (2014-2019)**, *Bachelor of Science (Honours), Computer Science & Statistics*

- **Research on Algorithms for High-dimensional Data Analysis** Performed literature review on algorithms for high-dimensional classification and feature selection; Conducted large-scale simulation studies to access the performance of several state-of-the-art packages; Composed technical report as undergraduate honours thesis.

- **[Image Processing Project](https://github.com/syumet/imCollec784)** Implemented a variety of algorithms for image manipulation, segmentation, and classification with Scikit-image, Scikit-learn, and Keras; Created documents combining the code and graphical results with Jupyter Notebook.

- **Sociolinguistics Project** Analyzed the interview data using Excel (t-test, rank correlation, anova) to study the factors influencing heritage language performance of Chinese immigrant children in Saskatchewan; Provided model suggestions and result interpretation to researchers without quantitative background.
